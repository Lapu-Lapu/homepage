# Welcome to my Homepage!

Hello, I am Benjamin Knopp, a postdoc working in the field of perception. My research focuses on human movement and understanding how it is perceived by individuals. 

I am also passionate about programming languages and enjoy exploring their capabilities in solving problems and improving our understanding of the world.

Feel free to explore my website to learn more about my research, projects, and interests. If you have any questions or would like to collaborate, please don't hesitate to [get in touch](mailto:benjamin.knopp@example.com).

Enjoy your stay!
