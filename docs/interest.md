Dr. Benjamin Knopp's research primarily focuses on the intersections of psychology and technology, particularly on the development and application of deep generative models to study face perception and human pose tracking. He is keen on leveraging technological tools and techniques, such as Motion Capture and Eyetracking, to further his research in the perception domain.

Additionally, he has a keen interest in Bayesian statistics, which he has extensively employed for model comparison in his research. His progressive and innovative process of engaging with these disciplines has yielded significant contributions to our understanding of how humans perceive and interact with their environment.
